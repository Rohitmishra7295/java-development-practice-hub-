🔐 What is Basic Auth?
Client sends username & password in every request header (Base64 encoded)

No login form UI

Common for APIs, CLI tools, testing, Postman


HTTP Basic Login

@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) {
http
    .authorizeHttpRequests(request -> request.anyRequest().authenticated())
    .httpBasic(withDefaults());
	return http.build();
}


🔄 How it works:
When accessing a protected resource, the browser or client is prompted for credentials.

Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)
