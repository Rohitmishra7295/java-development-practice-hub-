OAuth (Open Authorization) is an **open standard protocol** that allows **secure, delegated access** to resources without sharing credentials (like username/password). It is widely used to grant access to third-party applications to act on a user's behalf.

---

### üîë What is OAuth?

OAuth is a **token-based authorization framework** that allows an application (client) to access user data stored on another service (resource server), with the user's consent, **without exposing the user's credentials**.

OAuth is a security framework that lets apps (like Spotify or Medium) access your data (like your email or profile info) from another service (like Google) ‚Äî with your permission ‚Äî and without sharing your password.

**Note**
- OAuth solves  the problem of sharing sensitive login credentials directly with thirt-party applications.
---

### üß† Why OAuth?

1. **Security**: Prevents sharing passwords with third-party apps.
2. **Delegation**: You can allow limited access (like read-only access to your emails).
3. **Revocation**: You can revoke access anytime from your account settings.
4. **Scalability**: Used across platforms ‚Äî web, mobile, and desktop.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How OAuth Works (Flow Explained with Real-World Example)

> üì± **Example Use Case**: "Sign in with Google" on a third-party app (like Medium or Spotify).

Let‚Äôs break it down into **OAuth 2.0 roles** and **steps**:

#### üìå Key Components:

* **Resource Owner**: The person who owns the account and the data - typically the end user.
* **Third-Party Application**: An external app that wants to access the user‚Äôs data on another service.
* **Client**: This is the application that requests access to the server on behalf of the user (e.g., Spotify).
* **Authorization Server**: Where the user authenticates (e.g., Google).
* **Resource Server**: The server that holds and protects the user‚Äôs data (e.g., Google Contacts API).It Handles authentication and authorization.

### üîÑ OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow (Most common for web apps)

#### Step-by-step:

1. **User Clicks "Login with Google"**:

   * The client app (Spotify) redirects user to Google‚Äôs authorization server.
   * URL includes scopes like: `read_profile`, `email`.

2. **User Grants Permission**:

   * Google shows a consent screen.
   * If user agrees, Google redirects back to client with an **authorization code**.

3. **App Exchanges Code for Token**:

   * The client sends the authorization code to Google‚Äôs token endpoint.
   * Google returns:

     * `access_token` (used to access resources)
     * `refresh_token` (to get new access\_token after expiry)

4. **App Accesses Resources**:

   * Spotify uses `access_token` to request user info (like profile or email).

###  How OAuth 2.0 Works (With Google as Auth Provider)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    title OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow (Google Login Example)

    participant User as üë§ User (Resource Owner)
    participant ClientApp as üíª App (Client)
    participant GoogleAuth as üîê Google (Authorization Server)
    participant GoogleAPI as üóÇÔ∏è Google (Resource Server)

    %% Step 1: User initiates login
    User->>ClientApp: Clicks "Login with Google"

    %% Step 2: Redirect to Google Auth
    ClientApp->>GoogleAuth: Redirect with client_id, scopes, redirect_uri

    %% Step 3: Consent screen
    GoogleAuth->>User: Shows consent screen (email, profile)
    User->>GoogleAuth: Grants permission

    %% Step 4: Auth Code
    GoogleAuth->>ClientApp: Redirect with Authorization Code

    %% Step 5: Token Exchange
    ClientApp->>GoogleAuth: Sends Authorization Code + client_secret
    GoogleAuth->>ClientApp: Returns Access Token + Refresh Token

    %% Step 6: Access Protected Resources
    ClientApp->>GoogleAPI: Sends Access Token
    GoogleAPI->>ClientApp: Returns user profile data (name, email, picture)

    %% Optional Step 7: Auto-refresh expired token
    Note over ClientApp,GoogleAuth: Later, use Refresh Token to get new Access Token
```

### üîê Token Types

| Token             | Purpose                                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Access Token**  | Used to access protected resources. Short-lived.      |
| **Refresh Token** | Used to get a new access token. Long-lived.           |
| **ID Token**      | Contains user identity info. (Used in OpenID Connect) |

### üß™ Real-world OAuth Examples

| Application | OAuth Provider   | Purpose                      |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| GitHub      | Google, GitHub   | Sign in, access repositories |
| Medium      | Google, Twitter  | Login, share content         |
| Spotify     | Facebook, Google | Login, sync playlists        |
| Postman     | Any OAuth API    | Test authenticated endpoints |

### üîß How to Use OAuth in a Project

#### üìç Example: OAuth with Google in a React + Spring Boot App

1. **Register App with Google**

   * Go to [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
   * Create OAuth 2.0 credentials.
   * Set Redirect URI to something like: `http://localhost:3000/oauth2/redirect`

2. **Backend (Spring Boot)**

   * Use `spring-security-oauth2-client` and `spring-boot-starter-security`.
   * Configure:

     ```yaml
     spring:
       security:
         oauth2:
           client:
             registration:
               google:
                 client-id: <your-client-id>
                 client-secret: <your-client-secret>
                 scope: profile, email
     ```

3. **Frontend (React)**

   * Redirect to: `http://localhost:8080/oauth2/authorization/google`
   * After login, Spring will redirect back to frontend with JWT/session.

### üß† OAuth vs JWT

| Feature | OAuth                      | JWT                     |
| ------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Purpose | Authorization framework    | Token format            |
| Format  | Not fixed (uses tokens)    | JSON web token          |
| Usage   | Grants access to user data | Carries claims in token |

### üß© Variants of OAuth

| Flow Name                   | Use Case                                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Authorization Code**      | Web apps with backend                      |
| **Implicit Flow**           | Single Page Apps (legacy, not recommended) |
| **Client Credentials Flow** | Server-to-server apps                      |
| **Password Grant**          | Trusted apps (deprecated for public use)   |
| **Device Code Flow**        | Devices with limited UI (e.g., TV)         |

---

### ‚úÖ TL;DR

* **OAuth = secure delegated access to resources.**
* **Used by Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.**
* **Prevents password sharing, supports scopes, and token revocation.**
* **Used in modern apps for login and API authorization.**
